## Overview

### Product Vision

Our team developed a fashion e-commerce website inspired by modern retail platforms like NIKE, with an emphasis on athleticism, comfort, and modern style. The goal is to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive shopping experience.

Customers can browse, search, and purchase items by adding them to their cart. Unlike competitors, we aim to deliver innovative clothing that reflects the lifestyle and needs of active individuals. This is performance-driven fashion that supports athletic excellence and reflects everyday confidence.
